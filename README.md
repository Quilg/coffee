This is my final project. I have also used code found online, to further improve my application. For this, the database is already created, as I have all of the login and passwords already written for the employees. The line which uses Faker and is responsible to generating users is commented out. I was trying to also make a little adjustment to the project, by making it so that when the clerk assigns the order to a delivery, he is also obliged to enter the ID of the delivery man he wants to assign it to. But I wasn't able to accomplish that fully, so I will continue working on it. Other than that, everything was tested and ran without any problems. Chat GPT also helped me with some of the things I wasn't quite sure about, but I fully understand everything now and can easily make such applications.
